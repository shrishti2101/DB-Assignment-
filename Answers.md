Answer 1      Each product can have  multiple categories, but each category can have ony one product type . This represents a many-to-one relationship between the Product table and the Category table.
Answer 2      To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it,we use foreign key contraint in product table's category column -The category_id column in the Products table is a foreign key that references the category_id column in the Categories table. This ensures that each category_id in the Products table must exist in the Categories table, hence ensuring that each product has a valid category assigned to it.
